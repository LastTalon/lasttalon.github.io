						<p>Hello! I'm Lucas Gangstad and this is my website for my personal and professional work. This website is currently in development, so certain aspects may not work as intended. This website will have sections dedicated to my professional materials like my portfolio and resume, as well as links to future my project pages also contained on this website.</p>
						<p>This website currently doesn't contain much and I'm currently working on updating it with information about my projects. So, for now there's not a whole lot to see. Check back later for when I've added more!</p>
						<p>Below are cards <a href="#aboutme">about me</a> and <a href="#aboutwebsite">about this website</a>.</p>

					<h2>About me</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>As stated, I'm Lucas Gangstad and this is my website.</p>
						<p>I'm currently a student, attending the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. I'll be graduating in May with a B.S. of Computer Science. When I started attending I already had a good foundation of Computer Science knowledge, but have learned much more since I've been here. My largest upcoming project for school will be my senior seminar presentation on digital steganography that I'll be giving in April.</p>
						<p>I also do some programming in my free time. I typically enjoy programming and have many ideas for projects, some of which may show up on this website if I think they're good enough.</p>
						<p>I play videogames on my computer and chat with people online in my free time. I find videogames very compelling and interesting, enough so that I have a very good understanding of how they work. I also enjoy music, both listening and performing. Although, in recent years I have done very little playing of music while focusing on school. I do, however, enjoy singing, playing piano, and playing wind instruments. I hope sometime in the future to learn to play guitar.</p>
						<p>It is my current ambition to get into game development, preferably a paid game development position. I am, obviously, a programmer and would expect to be working in that field of game development, although I also understand game design and mechanics and think I would do well in that, although programming will remain my passion.</p>

					<h2>About this website</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>As mentioned above, this website is for my personal and professional work, mostly containing programs, games, school work, and mods I've made or worked on. It currently doesn't contain much and is in development.</p>
						<p>The entire website was designed and created by me to professionally present my work. Its form and function are designed with that in mind, although I am not a web designer. The style is very clean and easy to read, with clear delimiters between sections, hopefully making it easy to follow.</p>
						<p>It uses multiple cards on each page, each displaying its own section of information. Each card can have its own information, links, and buttons at the top and bottom. These are the primary content areas of the website.</p>
						<p>Any important links can be found on the navigation card. On most desktop browsers the navigation card should follow as you scroll. On small resolution desktop browsers or on most mobile browsers the navigation card will stay at the top of the page, although it can be easily jumped to by clicking the "Top" button at the bottom of each card.</p>
						<p>The pages contain both in-text links and buttons at the top and bottom of each card. Both types often link to other sections of information contained on the same page in different cards as well as to other pages. In-text links are used when another section is referenced within the text and buttons are used when its related to the text, but not necessarily mentioned.</p>
						<p>The website has both desktop and mobile versions, following the same style with minor changes in each to reflect that particular platform. On a desktop the mobile version can be viewed by making your browser window smaller.</p>
