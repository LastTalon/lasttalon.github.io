					<p>Hello! I'm Lucas Gangstad and this is my website. This website will have sections dedicated to my professional materials like my portfolio and resume, as well as links to project pages.</p>
					<p>This website currently doesn't contain much as I'm currently working on updating it with more information. For now you can view my portfolio. Check back later for when I've added more!</p>

				<h2>About me</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>I'm currently a student, attending the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. I'll be graduating in May with a B.S. of Computer Science. When I started attending I already had a good foundation of Computer Science knowledge, but have learned much more since I've been here. My largest project for school will be my upcoming senior seminar presentation on digital steganography that I'll be giving in April.</p>
					<p>I do some programming in my free time. I typically enjoy programming and have many ideas for projects, some of which may show up on this website if I think they're good enough.</p>
					<p>I also play videogames on my computer and chat with people online in my free time. I find videogames very compelling and interesting, enough so that I have a very good understanding of how they work. In addition, I enjoy music, both listening and performing. Although, in recent years I have done very little playing of music while focusing on school. I do, however, enjoy singing, playing piano, and playing wind instruments. I hope sometime in the future to learn to play guitar.</p>
					<p>It is my current ambition to get into game development. I am, obviously, a programmer and would expect to be working on that aspect of game development, although I also have a good understanding game design and mechanics.</p>

				<h2>About this website</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>This website was designed and created by me to present my work. Its clean style is designed with that in mind. However, I am not a web designer, hopefully its easy to follow.</p>
					<p>The website has both desktop and mobile versions, following the same style with minor changes in each to reflect that particular platform. Hopefully this makes the website more easily accessible.</p>
