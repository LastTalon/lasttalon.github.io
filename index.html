				<h2>About me</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>I'm a software developer with an appreciation for elegant and efficient code. I recently graduated in May from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville with my B.S. of Computer Science.</p>
					<p>I began learning about computer science and programming during my high school years. I started by learning to write minor scripts for my favorite videogames, and from there, proceeded to gain more knowledge from many of the computer science classes offered at my high school. While taking these classes, I gained an appreciation and love for programming, and decided I wanted to do that as my career. To pursue knowledge of compuer science further, I attended the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. I learned much more while there, gaining theoretical and practical knowledge, taking many classes, covering many different languages like C, C++, Java, C#, and Basic, and exploring many computer science topics such as security, networking, graphics, architecture, and language structures. I even gave a presentation on digital steganography in April of my senior year.</p>
					<p>I still write programs in my free time for enjoyment and the pursuit of knowledge. I often have a software development project that I'm working on, usually a game, application, or website of some sort. One of my major career goals is to create professional games and other software, and get them into the market. I'm open to collaboration on both hobbyist and professional projects.</p>
					<p>In my free time I play videogames like Overwatch, and chat with people online. Videogames are a passion of mine, and I have an experienced understanding of the mechanics and design choices that go into them. I also enjoy music, both listening and performing. In recent years, I've been busy doing other things and haven't had as much time to play music while focusing on school and other projects. Nonetheless, I still enjoy singing, playing piano, and listening to music, and I hope to learn to play the guitar in the future.</p>
